This plugin will remove comment reply classes and create custom classes for 
parents with zebra striping.

== Description ==

This plugin will remove comment reply classes and create custom classes for parents with zebra striping.  This may resolve issues with comment threading styles (even/odd) introduced in version 2.7.  See http://www.krues8dr.com/wordpress-unstyle-comment-replies-plugin/ for details.

Please note that there are the existing thread-even and thread-odd classes which may also work for you without this plugin. You may wish to try those first.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `unstyle_comment_replies` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Customize the classes you want to add/remove in the Settings Menu: Unstyle Comment Replies options.
